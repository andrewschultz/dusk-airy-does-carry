# Dusk, Airy, Does Carry

EctoComp 2025 Petite Mort entrant (3 of 3)

This was made after [Go-Strange-Ghost Range](https://andrewschultz.itch.io/dusk-airy-does-carry) with repository [here](https://github.com/andrewschultz/go-strange-ghost-range) and [Chez Dark Shade Ark](https://andrewschultz.itch.io/chez-dark-shade-ark) with repository [here](https://github.com/andrewschultz/chez-dark-shade-ark). I wasn't planning on a third, but the ideas piled up, and I had the time. It has ten rooms, all accessible after the initial puzzle, and twelve points. Each puzzle has a two-word solution, but some depend on others to move forward. The game, compiled, is [on itch.io](https://andrewschultz.itch.io/dusk-airy-does-carry).

The repository contains source code, a game map, a logic map and a walkthrough. The graphics subdirectory has, well, the graphics.

While it's a bit of a stretch for EctoComp, I was in the mood to draw a few more silly graphics, so I did. And there IS an evil wight to defeat.

Oh, it also ends with a cliche (and starts with one.) But I hope it's a funny take on said cliche.
