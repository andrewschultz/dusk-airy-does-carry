# Dusk, Airy, Does Carry

EctoComp 2025 Petite Mort candidate (3)

This was made after [Go-Strange-Ghost Range](https://github.com/andrewschultz/go-strange-ghost-range) and [Chez Dark Shade Ark](https://github.com/andrewschultz/chez-dark-shade-ark). I wasn't planning on it, but the ideas piled up. It has ten rooms and thirteen points.

The repository contains source code, a game map, a logic map and a walkthrough.

It's a bit of a stretch for EctoComp, but I was in the mood to draw a few more silly graphics, so I did.
