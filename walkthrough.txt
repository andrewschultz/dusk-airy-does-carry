Author's Walkthrough for Dusk, Airy, Does Carry

by Andrew Schultz

This was a submission to EctoComp Petite Mort 2025, where you had 4 hours to code. Graphics were not counted against the time limit. (Please, no cracks about how they wouldn't have counted much!)

The solution is, in the big picture, fairly straightforward. You need to find a way to defeat the wight in the second room, then find a way home. The map is branching. HONE AYE and HO NIGH can block off or unblock passages to places where you're done.

If you figure out some puzzles ahead of time, the game leaves the right command for reference in THINK.

======================================

You start by a globe, old.

> GLOW BOLD (1)

> U

You can't do much with the wight. So search around. It's equally fast to go east or west, though there's one small decision that may save a couple moves.

> E

> E

Car parts.

> CARP ARTS (1)

Incidentally, you can say CARP ART too! Adventuron accepts plural or singular forms of the second word by default.

> W

> N

Wheeze-ooze. (Or oohs.)

> WHEE ZOOS (1)

"Wee" is an alternate solution here.

Now you feel a blur, blasting ...

> BLURB LASTING (1)

> S

You can't fix a drought yet. But you can ...

> W

> W

Now if you go north you save a bit of time. In the west, you need something from the north to do everything, even after you score the point.

> N

A bro code!

> BROKE ODE (1)

A re-coder comes to fix it!

> REEK ODOR (1)

> S

> W

Dune/Ice.

> DEW NICE (1)

Here "do" was not specific enough so I had it clue something more physical.

Once you get this, you will pour the dew in the ale container you got from the plots. That gives you a hydration source. If you'd come here first, you'd have had to come back.

> E

And oh yes! Before I forget, you now have the verbal skill for ...

> SCAM PILL (1)

> E

> E

> AID ROUTE (1)

Note "AIDE" is a suitable synonym.

The blokes can't do anything in-game, but ...

> W

> N

> N

With the support you got from the aid route, and the coy nickel coin (ickle) ...

> K VROOM (1)

> S

You may know what to do with the whey cup, but you haven't finished your quest ...

> S

> WHY TRAINS (1)

They distract the wight enough you can disassemble the chair, from which the wight gains its powers.

> N

Now for the whey cup.

> WAKE UP (1)
